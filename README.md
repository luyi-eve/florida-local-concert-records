## Data Collection

### 🎵 Setlist.fm
I used [Setlist.fm's API](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html) to retrieve local concert data across Florida by city, covering the years 2014 through 2024, with the dataset current up until August 2024, when the analysis was finalized. However, since Setlist.fm does not provide genre classification for its artists, I had to turn to the Spotify API to get genre information for the data retrieved from Setlist.fm.
